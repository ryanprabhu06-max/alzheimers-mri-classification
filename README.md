Alzheimer’s MRI Classification – Capstone Project

This repository contains my final capstone project.

The goal of this project was to explore whether MRI-based brain measurements can be used to help classify cognitive status related to Alzheimer’s disease.

What I did
- Worked with MRI-derived brain feature data
- Built a basic machine learning pipeline
- Compared two models: LASSO and Random Forest
- Evaluated model accuracy and confidence levels

What this project shows
This project shows my experience working through a full data science workflow, from understanding the problem to evaluating results.

Limitations
- This is not a production system
- The dataset is not included
- Results depend on how the data is split and processed

Why I made this repo
I wanted a clean place to show one real project I worked on and continue improving it as I learn more.
